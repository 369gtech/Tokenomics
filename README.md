I will just give you a brief over view of the Tokenomics Table above. First off all the early adopters of this game will earn great rewards but as more people join those individual reward pools they will be divided diminishing your earning capacity, so this is a deflationary ecosystem but with sustainable features. The Pre-Sale of the monoGames Token (MTG) of 27,000,000,000 will be set at approx $0.001. There will be 9000 accounts for players investors who will need to stake 1,000,000 tokens of each of the 12 blockchain of monoGames for 5 years to earn this reward but players can as they wish, sell their investor stake to other players. There will be 900 accounts for whale investors who will need to stake 10,000,000 tokens of each of the 12 blockchains of monoGames for 5 years to earn this reward but whale investors can as they wish, sell their investor stake to other investors. monoGames will take into consideration that if we don't sell all player investor or whale investors accounts, that those accounts not sold maybe donated to sustainable social good causes. monoGames Team is a group of dedicated people like myself who believe in innovation, spend countless hours working on ideas and who really want to make a sustainable difference to the world using blockchain technology. So if you get named on the monoGames Team list you really have the same ambition as I do and you will be incredible rewarded. Game Developers (Game Dev's) who build and maintain games with monoGames earn this reward. Social Developers (Social Dev's) who build and maintain the social networks earn this reward. Sustainable Developers (Sustainable Dev's) who build and maintain the sustainable networks earn this reward. The Security of monoGames will look to fill this role with Auditors and Industry Leaders with sound knowledge of Cyber Security and Bot Accounts which we hope to reach out to Kevin Mitnick and the CTF Team to fill these positions. The Support Team for Questions & Answers, Tutorials and Abuse will work tirelessly to ensure monoGames players have a seamless experience when they need help. The NFT Art Community will be full of people who love to be creators, creating all the wonder NFT’s monoGames has to offer in the Game, Social and Sustainable aspects of monoGame. Promo’s and Giveaways will be headed by GaryVee hopefully at every level of monoGames to promote our wonderful game to the world with a small dedicated team from monoGames. Destiny Of The Universe P2E (DOU P2E) is the Flagship game of monoGames which will reward all parts of the game from battles, alliance battle, missions, guilds, tournaments and many other rewards associated with DOU P2E. The Social2E rewards the monoGames Social Lounge (monoSol), monoGames Social Media (monoMedia) and Faction Social Lounges. Whale Investors will earn revenue and Player Investors will revenue from staked tokens over 5 years. All NFT’s that are staked in monoGames will earn revenue. All Land staked in monoGames will earn revenue. Staking 1 million nftcryptomix tokens will earn revenue. So there are lots of ways for developers, players and investors to earn in monoGames.

2. 12 Blockchain Token Sustainable Buy Back Of The monoGames Token (MTG) at 10%
<p>The are 12 Blockchain Tokens that are apart and parcel of monoGames which includes Signum, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, DOGE, Pirate Chain, Dragonchain, Koinos, Hive, Wax, BSC and Zill. The Tokens that represent those blockchain in monoGames will sustain monoGames with a 10% buy back of monoGames Tokens as part of their Tokenomics. This will help monoGames be sustainable for another 5 years beyond the first 5 years. We hope to bring blockchain communities together to build a really strong community here at monoGames where we work together, build together and hopefully innovate the sustainable blockchain ecosystem  together.
</p><p>
3. Adding Blockchains In The Future
<p>When monoGames nears the end of the air drops or has used up the 12 Blockchain Token Sustainable Buy Back Of The monoGames Token (MTG) and the game needs an injection of funds to sustainably keep monoGames working then the team will look at adding new blockchain to monoGames in a mutual way. By this time monoGames should be a vibrant and thriving community and the community will vote who we should become the new blockchains of monoGames because those blockchains that do get voted in will benefit greatly with a lot of support from investment, development and players so its a win win for both parties to keep monoGames sustainable.
</p><p>
4. Interactive Sustainable Partnerships
<p>This is where monoGames partners with sustainable products and services to interact with the monoGames Metaverse and The Real World. These partnership will eventually lead to long term sponsorship deals with monoGames in several ways. If we look at sustainable energy, monoGames might partner with Tesla where Tesla sponsors monoGames and in return monoGames uses Tesla logo's on all our NFT energy devices you need to power up buildings, vehicles, portals, etc while also giving player rewards for using those NFT energy devices. We also want to go one step further, if anyone can prove they own any Tesla product or service through a Qcode verification system, monoGames would reward them for those devices too. All sponsorship deals would go back into monoGames ecosystem to keep it sustainable.
</p><p>
5. NFT Packs
<p>All NFT Packs sold will go back into monoGames in various ways but the its main purpose would be a buy of monoGames Tokens (MTG). We are looking at using some of the funds for Research and Development in Sustainability and Blockchain Development. We also hope NFT Packs will have a big impact in the sustainability and innovation of monoGames.
</p><p>
6. Land Packages
<p>Land Packages sold will go back into monoGames in various ways but the its main purpose would be a buy of monoGames Tokens (MTG). We are looking at using some of the funds for Research and Development in Sustainability and Blockchain Development. We also hope that Land Packages will also have a big impact in the sustainability and innovation of monoGames.
</p><p>
Summory
<p>We hope monoGames can deliver a great gaming, social and sustainable experience with investors, developers and players where we can all grow as a community with the right sustainable balance so we can create a dynamic, innovative, sustainable project which interacts with the Metaverse and The Real World. Looking at the tokenomics we can see there is a great plan and only time will tell if this will be one of the greatest projects of its time.
