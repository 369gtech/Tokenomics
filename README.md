3. 12 Blockchain Token Sustainable Buy Back Of The monoGames Token (MTG) at 20%
<p>There are 12 Blockchain Tokens that are part'n'parcel of monoGames which includes Signum, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, DOGE, Pirate Chain, Dragonchain, Koinos, Hive, Wax, BSC and Zill. Their Tokenomics will have a similar role in their respective communities to help them grow in the game and this will be discussed at a later date. The Tokens that represent those blockchain in monoGames will sustain monoGames with a 20% buy back of monoGames Tokens as part of their Tokenomics. This will help monoGames be sustainable for another 5 years beyond the first 5 years. We hope to bring blockchain communities together to build a really strong community here at monoGames where we work together, build together and hopefully innovate the sustainable blockchain ecosystem together with our Research and Development Program.
</p><p>
4. Adding Blockchains In The Future
<p>When monoGames nears the end of the air drops or has used up the 12 Blockchain Token Sustainable Buy Back Of The monoGames Token (MTG) and the game needs an injection of funds to sustainably keep monoGames working then the team will look at adding new blockchain to monoGames in a mutual way. By this time monoGames should be a vibrant and thriving community and the community will vote who should become the new blockchains of monoGames because those blockchains that do get voted in will benefit greatly with a lot of support from investment, development and players so it's a win win for both parties to keep monoGames sustainable.
</p><p>
5. Interactive Sustainable Partnerships
<p>This is where monoGames partners with sustainable products and services to interact with the monoGames Metaverse and The Real World. These partnership will eventually lead to long term sponsorship deals with monoGames in several ways. If we look at sustainable energy, monoGames might partner with Tesla where Tesla sponsors monoGames and in return monoGames uses Tesla logo's on all our NFT energy devices you need to power up buildings, vehicles, portals, etc while also giving player rewards for using those NFT energy devices. We also want to go one step further, if anyone can prove they own any Tesla product or service through a Qcode verification system, monoGames would reward them for those devices too. All sponsorship deals would go back into monoGames ecosystem to keep it sustainable.
</p><p>
6. NFT Packs
<p>All NFT Packs sold will go back into monoGames in various ways but its main purpose would be a buy back of monoGames Tokens (MTG) with 10% going directly into Research and Development. We also hope NFT Packs will have a big impact on the sustainability and innovation of monoGames.
</p><p>
7. Land Packages
<p>Land Packages sold will go back into monoGames in various ways but its main purpose would be a buy back of monoGames Tokens (MTG) with 10% going directly into Research and Development. We also hope that Land Packages will have a big impact on the sustainability and innovation of monoGames.
</p><p>
8. Research And Development
<p>The Research And Development arm of monoGames will look to innovate the sustainable blockchain ecosystem developing sustainable products and services. I have a number of projects I would like to come to fruition especially the Qcode Verification Sustainable Life Cycle Of Products, this is where we can track products and reward good recycling practices from players so we interact the Metaverse and The Real World to work together to make a difference to the world we live in for future generations. monoGames is open to ideas and if you have ideas that could contribute to help the world be more sustainable please contact us at our <a href="https://discord.gg/5V4Y7y2gwV">discord</a>.
</p><p>
9. Summary
<p>I hope monoGames can deliver a great gaming, social and sustainable experience with developers and players where we can all grow as a community with the right sustainable balance so we can create many dynamic, innovative, sustainable projects which can interact with the Metaverse and The Real World. Looking at the tokenomics we can see there is a great plan and only time will tell if this will be one of the greatest projects of its time.
