<h1>Tokenomics</h1>
<p>
The Tokenomics for monoGames will be discussed in more details when the road map is complete. What I can say is there is an nftcryptomix reward token now, there will be a monoGames token and there will also be tokens for each <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">faction<a/> coin associated with monoGames. These tokens will have time lines and how they will be allocated. Read the disclaimer as this may change as the game develops and evolves.
